# **hwtest**: A Scala testing library for homeworks

There are many great testing libraries in Scala. But most of them target
experienced programmers. In contrast, **hwtest** is intended for more
inexperienced programmers, especially in the context of a course where
* a teacher/instructor/TA creates the problems and provides test cases (in a lightweight format), and
* a student solves the problems and runs their code against the provided test cases to check their work.
If desired, the teacher could also run the student code against a more
extensive set of tests for grading purposes.

Of course, this is not a new idea, with variations going back decades and
with many tutorial websites working in a similar fashion. **hwtest**
implements this system for Scala and lets you create your own custom
problems.
